## Project Overview

This project is a Go-based application, built using the Go programming language. The main entry point of the application is the `main.go` file. This application demonstrates the use of a type switch statement in Go.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Go installed on your system (version 1.18 or higher)
* A code editor or IDE of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alianjo/go-training-examples
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd go-training-examples/switch
```
3. Build the application using the following command:
```bash
go build main.go
```
4. Run the application using the following command:
```bash
./main
```

### Usage

This application can be used as a starting point for building Go-based applications that utilize type switch statements. The `main.go` file contains the main entry point of the application, which defines a function `TypeDefine` that uses a type switch statement to determine the type of a given interface.

## Code Explanation

The `TypeDefine` function takes an interface as an argument and uses a type switch statement to determine its type. The function then prints a message indicating the type of the interface. The main function calls `TypeDefine` with various types of arguments to demonstrate its usage.

## Example Use Cases

* Determining the type of a variable at runtime
* Handling different types of data in a generic function
* Implementing type-specific logic in a Go program
